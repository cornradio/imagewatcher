# imagewatcher
name every image file by num , as you drag it in spicify floder

so
this is a program designed for myself
that i can drag *interesting photos* and do not have any wired looking filenames.

it will be like:
```
*drag*
  1.png
*drag*
  2.png
*drag*
  3.webp
*drag*
  4.gif  
```


we have 3 py files here:
- pwatch.py : for windows , it will watch the floder c:/test , you should mkdir first.
- pwatch-formac.py :  for MacOS, watch /Users/kasusa/Desktop/Pic ,  you should mkdir first, too.
- watch-input.py : for windows , and you can specify floder to watch ! how nice!
